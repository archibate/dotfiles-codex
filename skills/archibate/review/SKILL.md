  Review code for bugs, AI slop patterns, or documentation issues, then fix
  them interactively. This skill should be used after completing a major code
  modification or large multi-file edits — or when the user says "review",
  "review changes", "any bugs?", "review AI slop", "clean up AI code",
  "review docs", "code review".

# Review

Infer intent, scope, and review mode from what the user said. No formal arguments.

**Agent** (by intent):

| Intent          | Agent(s)              |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| bugs (default)  | `code-review`         |
| AI slop         | `ai-slop-review`      |
| documentation   | `doc-review`          |
| "full review"   | all three in parallel |

**Scope**: specific files if mentioned, `git diff` if uncommitted changes exist, else project directory.

## Steps

### 1. Launch Review

Determine scope and launch the appropriate agent(s). Tell the agent the target
(file paths or `"git diff"`). For "full review", launch all three agents in
parallel.

Assign codename prefix per source so findings stay attributable when streams
merge: **C** = `code-review`, **S** = `ai-slop-review`, **D** = `doc-review`.
Number within each prefix from 1 (e.g., `C1`, `C2`, `S1`, `D1`).

If every launched agent returned a no-issues line, emit a one-line all-clear
and stop — skip steps 2–7.

### 2. Create Issue List

Assign each finding a short codename (1-2 letter prefix + number) and
`TaskCreate` each. Emit a terse receipt — one bulleted line per codename,
in the order the agents returned them. Format: `- **codename** — issue title`
(no severity yet; severity lands in step 5's table after verification).

Each task body carries `Detail:` (the issue) and `Suggested Fix:` (the
agent's recommendation). Source is encoded by the codename prefix.

Example:

> - **C1** — Silent exception swallow
> - **C2** — Early-return swallows JSON parse errors
> - **S1** — Duplicate list comprehension
> - **S2** — Duplicated arg handling

### 3. Verify Findings

Before the list is treated as actionable, locate each reported finding in the
actual code and sanity-check it. Agents can hallucinate, misread, or describe
real issues inaccurately — pruning these up front keeps the quick-wins batch
and the fix cycle honest.

For each codename:
1. Read the cited `file:line` (or grep for the symbol if no location is given)
2. Confirm the described behavior matches what the code actually does — not
   what the agent inferred
3. Classify:
   - ✅ **confirmed** — real and accurately described; keep as-is
   - ⚠️ **partial** — real issue but description is off; `TaskUpdate` with the
     corrected description
   - ❌ **false positive** — agent misread or fabricated; `TaskUpdate` to
     `deleted` with a one-line reason (e.g., "agent assumed X but
     `path.py:42` actually does Y")

Keep this a lightweight pass — just enough to trust the list. Deep call-site
tracing and related-logic checks stay in step 6's per-issue investigation.

Before moving on, give the user a terse verification report — tally plus
per-codename outcomes. Confirmed codenames collapse into one line; ⚠️/❌
entries get one-line reasons. Example:

> 6 confirmed (C1, C3, S1–S2, D1–D2) · 1 partial · 2 false positives
> - ⚠️ C4 — agent said X, actually Y (description updated)
> - ❌ C2 — agent misread the early-return at `util.py:12`
> - ❌ S3 — agent fabricated the call site

The updated list with file locations renders in step 5.

### 4. Quick Wins

Among verified issues, append `*` to the severity cell only when ALL of:

- single-file, single-hunk diff
- no signature or API change
- no runtime behavior change
- no logic restructure (only renames, formatting, dead-code removal, typo
  fixes, missing imports)

If any check fails, leave unmarked. When in doubt, do not mark — the user
can always promote during the pick-discuss-fix cycle.

### 5. Render Final Table

Now that verification (step 3) has pruned false positives and quick-win
marking (step 4) has starred mechanical fixes, render the single
authoritative summary table the user picks from. Severity encoding:
🔴 high / 🟡 moderate / 🟢 low — with `*` appended to the severity cell for
quick-wins.

| Codename | Severity | File:Line       | Issue                           |
|----------|----------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| C1       | 🔴       | parser.py:42    | Silent exception swallow        |
| S1       | 🔴*      | util.py:88      | Duplicate list comprehension    |
| S2       | 🟡       | cli.py:12       | Duplicated arg handling         |
| D1       | 🟢       | README.md:3     | Broken internal link            |

_\* = quick-win (batch-fixable without behavior change)_

The table is for scanning; full content stays in each task body (per step 2).
Then offer to batch-fix all quick-wins before entering the interactive cycle.

### 6. Pick-Discuss-Fix Cycle

After rendering the final table (step 5), and after each resolved issue,
recommend **exactly 3 next issues**. Format:
`**codename** [severity] — issue title` (a brief recall of *what* the issue
is, not the fix direction). If fewer than 3 remain, show all remaining.

Then wait for the user to reply with a bare codename (e.g., "C1"). Process:

1. **Investigate** — mark task `in_progress`; read the cited `file:line`,
   trace call sites, check related logic. For doc issues, verify the claim
   against the referenced code/behavior (not just the prose). If the agent's
   report turns out wrong, note it in the recommendation below.

2. **Explain + recommend** — pick Shape A (recommend fix) or Shape B
   (recommend skip), emit it, wait for the user.

   **Shape A — recommending fix:**

   **C1** [🔴] — Silent exception swallow

   🔍 **Reason**: <one sentence, under 10 words>
   🛠️ **Fix plan**: <one sentence>
   ⚠️ **Risk**: <what the fix could break, one sentence>
   <optional ```diff block``` when the change is small>

   User replies `fix` (continue to stage 3) or `skip` (mark task
   `deleted`, jump to "recommend next 3").

   **Shape B — recommending skip:**

   **C1** [🔴] — Silent exception swallow

   🔍 **Reason**: <one sentence, under 10 words>
   ⏸️ **Skip**: <one clause why>

   User replies `skip` to confirm (mark task `deleted`, jump to
   "recommend next 3") or `fix anyway` to override (continue to stage 3).

   Phrase reason/fix/risk at *concept level*, not code level: state the
   observability gap and the behavior change, not the variables or call
   sites. The diff carries the concrete detail.

   ❌ Avoid: "`parse_response()` at `api.py:42` swallows `JSONDecodeError`
   via bare `except:`; add an explicit `ValueError` raise so callers see
   malformed input."
   ✅ Good: "Parse errors silently swallowed. Re-raise so callers can
   handle."

3. **Fix** — execute the edits. If testable, run a quick check (import,
   minimal script, unit test; for doc fixes, re-read the referenced code to
   verify). If the test reveals the fix is wrong, revise before continuing.
   Mark task `completed`.

4. **Report** — emit the fix close-out:

   `✅ **C1** Fixed — <one short sentence>`

   Append at most one short sentence per applicable caveat:
   - `📝 Plan delta: <one sentence>` — executed change deviated from plan.
   - `🧪 Untested: <one sentence>` — display-only / pure refactor / no harness.
   - `🔄 Downstream: <one sentence>` — re-run / rebuild / migration needed.
   - `🆕 Surfaced: **codename** [severity] — <title>` — one line per new codename.

   No prose rationale, no insights block, no narrative beyond the sentences above.

Then recommend the next 3.

**Rules:**
- After each resolved issue, show only the next 3 — do not dump the full list.
- If the user adjusts the fix plan during stage 2, revise stage 3 accordingly.
- If investigation or the fix surfaces a *distinct* issue outside the
  current codename's scope, `TaskCreate` it with the next number under the
  appropriate prefix (`C`/`S`/`D` per the source of the new finding).
  Do not expand the current fix; it lands in the next `recommend 3`
  block and as `🆕 Surfaced` in stage 4's report.

### 7. Wrap Up

When all issues are resolved or skipped:

1. **Sanity check first** — run `git diff --stat` and skim each changed file.
   Look for: line-number drift in comments/docs, stale references to removed
   symbols, inconsistencies between related edits (spec ≡ code, comment ≡
   implementation). If anything is found, file it via `TaskCreate` with the
   next codename and re-enter step 6's pick-discuss-fix cycle. Wrap-up
   resumes only after the new queue is drained.

2. Show a final tally table — same column order as step 5, with `File:Line`
   dropped, `Resolution` appended, and a `Note` column summarising what was
   actually done (for `✅ fixed`) or why it was deferred (for `⏸️ skipped`).
   Resolution maps 1:1 to task state: ✅ fixed (task `completed`) or
   ⏸️ skipped (task `deleted`). Keep each `Note` to one line; it describes
   the *actual* change, which may differ from the agent's suggested fix.
   Example:

   | Codename | Severity | Issue                        | Resolution | Note                                      |
   |----------|----------|------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
   | C1       | 🔴       | Silent exception swallow     | ✅ fixed   | Replaced bare `except:` with `ValueError` |
   | S1       | 🔴*      | Duplicate list comprehension | ✅ fixed   | Extracted to `_filter_active()` helper    |
   | S2       | 🟡       | Duplicated arg handling      | ⏸️ skipped | User deferred — planned for a later PR    |
   | D1       | 🟢       | Broken internal link         | ✅ fixed   | Updated link target to current path       |

3. Summarize downstream actions required (re-runs, rebuilds, tests, migrations, etc.)
4. Offer to commit if there are changes
