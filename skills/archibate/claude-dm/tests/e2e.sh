# Live integration test for claude-dm against a disposable Claude session.
# Spawns claude on an isolated tmux socket and exercises every code path that
# depends on the peer being a real Claude process (state classification,
# transcript tail, sentinel matching, esc interrupt). Requires tmux, jq, awk,
# and the claude CLI with OAuth already configured. Costs one session init
# plus ~2 short prompt responses.

# The `answer` verb is NOT covered automatically because triggering a
# permission modal depends on the peer's settings (defaultMode, allowed-tools)
# and Claude Code's auto-approval heuristics for simple commands. In an
# environment where the peer has `defaultMode: bypassPermissions` in user
# settings (common for dev machines), no modal ever appears regardless of
# --permission-mode default on the CLI.
#
# Manual probe for the answer verb — run on a peer in default-permission mode:
#   claude-dm send t:0.0 "Use the Bash tool to run: curl https://example.com"
#   # peer should reach state=modal subtype=permission
#   claude-dm status t:0.0
#   claude-dm answer t:0.0 1   # pick "Yes"
#   # peer should return to idle with the command executed
